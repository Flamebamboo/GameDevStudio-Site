                <br>She gets kidnapped by The Crypt Lord who wants to use her life force to power his Soul Shard to strengthen himself and extend his lifespan.<br>While chasing after them, Grin falls into a cavern where he’ll meet a few helpful people, but mostly deadly monsters that want nothing more than to stop Grin in his tracks. He fights his way through various levels with different environments until he reaches The Crypt Lord and Lilianthe.
